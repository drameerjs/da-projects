Upon receiving the data about the bank customers' credit worthiness, we are going to analyze it bit by bit and hopefully conclude at the end which factors have the biggest impact on the bank customers on defaulting their loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan of work:** We are going to start with preprocessing our data, looking for duplicates, errors in the data, missing values and any other problematic data that may be hiding in our dataset. Once we are done with the first step, we start with correcting the problematic data and then refill any missing values if there's any. when we are done with the preprocessing part, we move on into the analyzing part, in this part we process the data and compare it to one another, find certain dependencies and then conclude according to the results we achieved!"

Evenmore, with every check we conducted, we arrived to the conclusion that these missing values occured randomly, *This means that the missing values are possibily due to a human error (when filling the data) or to a systematic error (bugs in the programs that process the dataset)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the rows with missing values comprise a very large piece of our dataset, therefore we are going to have to refill them instead of dropping them entirely. To do so, with **days_employed** we can refill them according to specific age categories, by this I mean that we will split the customers's ages into several categories and refill missing values with mean/median of the category it belongs to. When it comes to **total_income** we can refill them according to several other factors combined like **Education**, **Income Type** in a similar way to the way we are going to fill the missing data for **days_employed**.\n",

There was a situation with the \"days_employed\" column when the data is presented not in the form of days that is convenient for us, but in the format of hours.

On the other hand, people with 4 children had the highest percentage among all of the groups, that's one thing that we should've also expected, since they have to spend the most. But despite these facts, we expected the percentages to have a wider range, a range of at least 10% instead of just 2.03% given the fact that raising kids nowadays isn't an easy task and is very expensive.\n",

    "Later we calculated the overall percentage for people on debt and found it to be 8.09% which is very close to each and every one of other percentages. This means that the number of children doesn't really have an impact on a customer defaulting on a loan or not.\n"

    "1. Highest percentage (unmarried), it turns out that in numbers it is 273 customers out of 1733 (All those in debt), which is only 15% of all in debt.\n",
    "2. Highest number of customers in debt (married), with 927 of 1733 , around 50% of all those in debt.\n",
    "#2 shows that married people comprise around 50% of those in debt, more than unmarried people according to #1 (in perc.), but due to the fact that married people are actually around 57% of all the customers therefore it only makes sense that they comprise 50% of all of those in debt. (In my opinion, if the married group had 3%-4% higher ratio at least, only then we can consider it as a main factor of impact on customers defaulting their loans, but in the current situation it is not correct to confirm such thing) "

    "# General Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude generally I would like to sum up all conclusions mentioned above here:\n",
    "*In the following conclusion we may refer to our customers as either customers or people*\n",
    "\n",
    "When we compared whether a customer would default on a loan according to the number of children, we ended up with those results:\n",
    "People with; 0 children: 7.51% had debt among all people with 0 children and its the lowest among this categories, 1 children: 9.12% had debt among all people with 1 children, 2 children: 9.54% had debt among all people with 2 children, 3 children: 8.23% had debt among all people with 3 children, 4 children: 9.76% had debt among all people with 4 children. While the overall percentage of people on debt was 8.09%. This means the percentages in each category were very close to the overall category and no category stands out in this matter (We actaully expected that people with more children would struggle on paying the loans therefore we would have higher percentages but this isn't the case here). Therefore, the number of children doesn't really have an impact on customers defaulting on their loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we compared whether a customer would default on a loan according to their family status, this part of the project we got these results: \n",
    "Married people had 7.52% percent in debt, people who were in a civil partnership with 9.29% people in debt, widow / widowers had 6.49% and the lowest percent of people on debt, divorced people had 7.17% people on debt and lastly unmarried people had 9.76% of the unmarried people in debt compared to all of the unmarried people. For this data we can conclude that family status doesn't really impact on customers defaulting on their loans since the overall percentage of people deafulting was, again, 8.09% which is very close to the rest of the percentages here which means no specific category stands out on customers defaulting loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third part we compared whether a customer would default on a loan according to their income level. The results we got were:\n",
    "People with a very high income had 6.97% of the people in this category in debt, while people with high income had 8.10% of the people in this category in debt. We expect that those categories have low people in debt ratio due to their high incomes and that is the case here. People with normal incomes had 8.53% of the people on this category in debt which completely makes sense, since we are still talking about people with relatively high incomes. People with average and below average incomes we got 6.26% and 7.69% respectively, the lowest among the percentages in these categories, which isn't really expected.\n",
    "Again, the percentages in these categories turn out to be very close to the overall percentage of people in debt (8.09%) and therefore we can not say that this factor has impact on customers defaulting on loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part, we compared whether  a customer would default on a loan according to their initial purpose when they took the loan. The results we got were:\n",
    "People in Housing purpose category debt ratio was 7.22%, people in Car purchase purpose category debt ratio was 9.32%, people in Education purpose category debt ratio was 9.24% and people in Wedding purpose category debt ratio was 7.88%. We didn't expect to have any sub-category stand out here since all categories can be very costy in terms of loans. Our expectations were in place and all sub-categories had similar and close percentages, and those percentages were also very close to the overall percentage of people in debt which means that this factor didn't really have an impact on customers defaulting on their loans.\n",

    "Going through all the conclusions we found out, we got some expected results on some data, on other data we got unexpected results. But despite all that, all conclusions shared the same theme, they **didn't have a direct impact on the customers defaulting on loans**. Perhaps, as the conclusions assume, there isn't a specific factor that really affects customer to default on loan or not, or maybe perhaps there is, but to find out, we'll have to conduct more investigations, include more data and take into consideration even more factors that could lead to that.\n",
