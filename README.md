This repoistory contains all of the data analysis projects I have made so far. All the projects were created on datasets from Practicum bootcamp, and all projects were reviewed by reviews from Practicum - all reviews were included in these projects.

The projects are in the form of a jupyter notebook - I've also included a PDF version of the projects. 
Simple projects are my very first projects - simple, short and straight forward. BA stands for business analytics, BA folder includes projects regarding business analytics. Lastly, advnaced projects are my very last and recent projects, a little bit more complicated than all the other projects - some included ML, some dashboards, and some presentations.
